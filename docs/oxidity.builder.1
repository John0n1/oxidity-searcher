NAME
    oxidity.builder - Rust-based MEV searcher and bundle submitter

SYNOPSIS
    oxidity.builder --config <path> [ENV...]

DESCRIPTION
    Watches pending transactions and optional MEV-Share hints, simulates
    sandwich/backrun bundles, and submits them to builders/relays. Maintains
    lightweight PnL in SQLite and exposes metrics/log-level controls.

OPTIONS
    --config PATH      Path to the TOML config (see config.example.toml).
    --help             Show brief help.

ENVIRONMENT
    PRIVATE_KEY        Hex-encoded signing key (0x-prefixed).
    RPC_URL            RPC endpoint with mempool access.
    METRICS_TOKEN      Bearer token required for /metrics and /log-level
                       when enabled.
    CHAINS             Comma-separated chain IDs; runtime uses the first.

FILES
    config.example.toml   Sample configuration.
    oxidity_builder.db    Default SQLite database (auto-migrated).
    docs/*.md             Detailed setup and operational docs.

SECURITY
    Metrics/log endpoints bind to 127.0.0.1 by default; expose publicly only
    behind a trusted proxy with METRICS_TOKEN set. Avoid sending unrelated
    transactions from the same key to prevent nonce clashes with the bundle
    lease manager.
